# Issue Forum

This is a full-stack jwt user authenticated forum website with React on the frontend and Express/MongoDB/Mongoose on the backend. The app allows an individual to login/create an account, browse issues posted by other users and ordered by popularity, rate those issues, post their own issue, and view their own posted issues. The user can also log out of their account and start from the beginning.
